## For Kirby CMS

This repository includes plugins, panel fields, widgets, kirbytext tags ect for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/).

To make it simple, we use the Github issue tracker as a **[plugin list](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues)**.

## What is a plugin?

In Kirby a plugin is something that goes into the `plugins` folder.

**In this repository a plugin is anything related to Kirby that is not a theme.**

### Examples

- [Plugins](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3APlugin)
- [Panel fields](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Panel+fields%22)
- [Widgets](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues?q=widget+label%3A%22Panel+widgets%22)
- [Kirbytext tags](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues?q=kirbytext+label%3A%22Kirbytext+tag%22)

## Find a plugin

Github issue tracker has a built in [search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues). If that is not enough you can filter the plugins by one or more labels.

## Submit a plugin

1. [Search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues) for the url in the repository to make sure the plugin does not already exist.
1. [Add the plugin](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins/issues/new).
1. Make sure not to close the issue. It should remain open.

You can add labels, but only if you are a collaborator. I can change the privileges when needed.

## Report a plugin

Maybe a plugin does not work with the latest version of Kirby or has security issues. Then it's good for other people to know about it.

- You can comment in the plugin issue on why the plugin as a bad one.
- If you are a collaborator you can add the label `WARNING`.
- If other people agree about the warning, also edit the initial comment and write why people should not use it.

In these cases, don't delete/close the issue, because then the chance is big that the plugin returns and no one knows about the danger it brings.

If the site of the plugin is deleted, the the issue can be closed.

## Future

Maybe I or someone else will build a website around it with [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/) to makes it more visually appealing.

## Responsibility

This repository does not take any responsibility for the harm the plugin can do.
